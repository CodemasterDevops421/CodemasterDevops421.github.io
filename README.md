# Melam Chaitanya Kumar — Portfolio

Static portfolio website built with **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a pinch of vanilla **JavaScript**.
The refreshed design is responsive, accessible, and includes a dark/light mode toggle.

## Development
No build tools are required. Edit the HTML/CSS/JS files directly and open `index.html` in a browser or host the repository via GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `index.html` – main site markup and Tailwind configuration.
- `styles.css` – custom styles (flat cards, reduced-motion support).
- `script.js` – dark mode, footer year update.

## Deployment
Push changes to the `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.
